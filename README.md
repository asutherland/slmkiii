# libslmkiii

libslmkiii is a Python library to alter Novation SL MkIII files programatically.

## Installation

Nothing yet, PyPI package Coming Soonâ„¢

## Why?

The Novation Components interface is a great tool for quick updates, but the point-and-click interface is tedious.  I have more gear that I care to admit and creating templates via the UI got unruly very quick. This allows much faster editing of SL MkIII templates either programmatically or via any text editor that can handle JSON.

I probably could have point-and-clicked all of the templates I needed in the time I wrote this, but I love a good data deep-dive. Hopefully someone else can benefit as well.

## Usage

### From Scratch
Create a blank file:
```python
import slmkiii

template = slmkiii.Template()
template.save('my_new_template.json')
```

Edit `my_new_template.json` to your hearts content, then convert to sysex template file:
```python
import slmkiii

template = slmkiii.Template('my_new_template.json')
template.save('my_new_template.syx')
```

Import into the Novation Components utility and send to your SL MkIII!

### Examples
See `examples/`

### Testing

Simple unittest
`python -m unittest test`

Code coverage
`coverage run -m unittest tests && coverage report -m`

### Future

* PyPi release
* Remove manual utility step with push/pull via MIDI

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. This has 100% coverage, barring lookup table hackery and the like. As the spec can change at any moment, please keep the coverage as high as possible!

## License

Tl;dr: Do whatever you want with it and I'd appreciate a shoutout. Don't blame me if your gear bursts into flames, though.
